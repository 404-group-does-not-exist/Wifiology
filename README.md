# Wifiology

Wifiology is a system for capturing and analyzing 802.11 traffic to gain insight about spectrum usage,
potential rogue access points, and other interesting WiFi phenomenon. This codebase is the central
server portion of Wifiology, which collects and aggregates data from listener nodes 
(https://github.com/404-group-does-not-exist/client_proof_of_concept). The Wifiology server uses
NodeJS 10 with a Postgres 9.6+ database.
